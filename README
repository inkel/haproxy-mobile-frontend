HAProxy mobile frontend
=======================

I love HAProxy and its stats page, however that page is not optimized
at all for mobile devices, so I decided to do a version for mobile
devices. And also because I liked the idea of playing a little with
jQuery Mobile, Ruby and Sinatra ;)

Also the HAProxy CSV parsing library... sucks. A lot. My final goal is
that once this applications runs smoothly convert this HAProxy library
to a gem, so it's possible to be used from another project.

Configuration
-------------

The application currently deals with only one configuration parameter,
the path to HAProxy stats socket. However it's still hardcoded (line
9, in the call to HAProxy.connect(uri) method.)
