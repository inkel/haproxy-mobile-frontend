HAProxy mobile frontend

I love HAProxy and its stats page, however in mobile devices that page
is not optimized at all for mobile devices, so I decided to do a
version for mobile devices. And also because I liked the idea of
playing a little with jQuery Mobile, Ruby and Sinatra ;)

So far this version uses a cached CSV file from HAProxy demo page. I'm
planning to connect the Sinatra server to HAProxy stats socket, so
it's easier and faster to get current stats.

Also the HAProxy CSV parsing library... sucks. A lot. I'm also
planning in making it way better, as a separated gem so it can be used
in different projects. When am I going to achieve this? No idea.
